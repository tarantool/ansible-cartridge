# Multiversion

The default versioning approach for Tarantool Cartridge applications is quite simple:

* only one version of application is installed on machine;
* updating instance happens on instance restart.

Such approach doesn't protect from accidental updating instance, that can lead to
errors (for example, if router starts to use new schema earlier than storages).
The solution is using multiversion approach (currently it's fully supported only
for [TGZ](/doc/tgz.md) packages).

Multiversion approach:

* several versions of application can be installed on machine;
* each instance uses fixed version - it is achieved by using symbolic links;
* updating instance consists of:
  * moving it's link to a newest version of application
    (see [`update_instance` step](/doc/scenario.md#update_instance));
  * instance restart.

## Configuration

All versions of application are placed in
`{{ cartridge_app_install_dir }}/{{ cartridge_app_name }}-{{ version }}`
directory.

Symbolic links for instances are placed in
`{{ cartridge_app_instances_dir }}/{{ cartridge_app_name }}.{{ instance-name }}`.

For example, we deploy `myapp-1.0.0-0.tgz` and start `instance-1`, `instance-2`
and statebord.

* Application files are placed in `{{ cartridge_app_install_dir }}/myapp-1.0.0-0`:
  ```bash
  {{ cartridge_app_install_dir }}/myapp-1.0.0-0/
    tarantool
    init.lua
    ...
  ```
* Instances links are placed in `cartridge_app_instances_dir`:
  ```bash
  {{ cartridge_app_instances_dir }}/
    myapp.instance-1 -> {{ cartridge_app_install_dir }}/myapp-1.0.0-0
    myapp.instance-2 -> {{ cartridge_app_install_dir }}/myapp-1.0.0-0
    myapp-stateboard -> {{ cartridge_app_install_dir }}/myapp-1.0.0-0
  ```

## Example

Let's imagine that we already have `myapp-1.0.0-0` installed:

```bash
{{ cartridge_app_install_dir }}/
  myapp-1.0.0-0/
```

`storage-1`, `storage-2`and `core-1` are using this version of application:

```bash
{{ cartridge_app_instances_dir }}/
  myapp.storage-1 -> {{ cartridge_app_install_dir }}/myapp-1.0.0-0
  myapp.storage-2 -> {{ cartridge_app_install_dir }}/myapp-1.0.0-0
  myapp.core-1 -> {{ cartridge_app_install_dir }}/myapp-1.0.0-0
```

And now the day has come and we want to deploy next version: `myapp-2.0.0-0.tgz`.
Let's write a playbook that installs new version and updates storages.

**Note**: it may be useful to specify hosts pattern, e.g. `hosts: *storage*`.

```yaml
- name: Update package
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - import_role:
        name: tarantool.cartridge
      vars:
        cartridge_package_path: "./myapp-2.0.0-0.tgz"
        cartridge_scenario:
          - update_package

- name: Update storages
  hosts: "*storage*"
  tasks:
    - import_role:
        name: tarantool.cartridge
      vars:
        cartridge_package_path: "./myapp-2.0.0-0.tgz"
        cartridge_scenario:
          - update_instance
          - restart_instance
```

After running this playbook `instance-1` and stateboard use `myapp-2.0.0-0`,
but `instance-2` continue to use `myapp-1.0.0-0`:

```bash
{{ cartridge_app_install_dir }}/
  myapp-1.0.0-0/
  myapp-2.0.0-0/
```

```bash
{{ cartridge_app_instances_dir }}/
  myapp.storage-1 -> {{ cartridge_app_install_dir }}/myapp-2.0.0-0
  myapp.storage-2 -> {{ cartridge_app_install_dir }}/myapp-2.0.0-0
  myapp.core-1 -> {{ cartridge_app_install_dir }}/myapp-1.0.0-0
```
