# Role Scenario

The role uses a scenario to determine what to do. Scenario consists of steps that can be configured.

Using a scenario of steps, you can:

- run the specified steps in any order, but API must be followed (with `cartridge_scenario`);
- replace the steps of the role with your own or add new steps
  (with `cartridge_custom_steps_dir` or `cartridge_custom_steps`).

## Steps

In `cartridge_scenario` you should specify names of steps. The default scenario includes the following steps:

- [deliver_package](#deliver_package)
- [update_package](#update_package)
- [update_instance](#update_instance)
- [configure_instance](#configure_instance)
- [restart_instance](#restart_instance)
- [wait_instance_started](#wait_instance_started)
- [connect_to_membership](#connect_to_membership)
- [edit_topology](#edit_topology)
- [cleanup_expelled](#cleanup_expelled)
- [configure_auth](#configure_auth)
- [configure_app_config](#configure_app_config)
- [bootstrap_vshard](#bootstrap_vshard)
- [configure_failover](#configure_failover)

There are additional steps that are not included in the default scenario, but can be used in a custom one:

- [set_control_instance](#set_control_instance)

To replace the steps of the role with your own or add new steps, you should use `cartridge_custom_steps_dir`
or `cartridge_custom_steps` options.

## Examples

### Adding custom step to scenario

You can create your own step and include it to scenario. Let's create `./custom_steps/special_magic.yml`. After that,
you can add `special_magic` step to scenario. Just pass path to a directory where your custom steps are placed:

```yaml
- name: My playbook
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Deploy application
      import_role:
        name: tarantool.cartridge
      vars:
        cartridge_custom_steps_dir: "./custom_steps"
        cartridge_scenario:
          - restart_instance
          - special_magic
```

### Importing steps from different directories

If you want to import steps by full paths, `cartridge_custom_steps` parameter can be useful. It allows specifying
mapping between step name and path to file to import:

```yaml
cartridge_custom_steps:
  - name: 'common_special_task'
    file: './common/special_task.yml'
```

### Override task from default scenario

Sometimes we need to use default scenario, but change some steps realizations.

For example, in default scenario package specified by `cartridge_package_path` is simple copied to remote host by
step `deliver_package`. We might want to deliver package to remote machine by our own way. Let's do it!

Generally, we just need to override default `deliver_package` step.

Let's take a look on it's [API](#deliver_package). It requires two variables:

- `cartridge_package_path` that we simply specify in vars;
- `single_instances_for_each_machine` that allows us to run this task once per each machine.

As a result of this module we should set `delivered_package_path` variable
(a path of package on remote machine).

Now, choose a directory where our custom steps are placed, for example `./custom_steps`.

Then create `./custom_steps/deliver_package.yml` and describe a way to deliver package:

```yaml
# ./custom_steps/deliver_package.yml

- when:
    - cartridge_package_path is not none
    - inventory_hostname in single_instances_for_each_machine
  tags: cartridge-instances
  block:
    - name: 'Download package'
      get_url:
        url: 'https://some-server/myapp-1.0.0-0.rpm'
        dest: '/tmp'
      register: downloaded_package

    - name: 'Set delivered package path'
      set_fact:
        delivered_package_path: '{{ downloaded_package.dest }}'
```

Import role and say where to find our custom steps:

```yaml
# deploy_application.yml

- name: My playbook
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Deploy application
      import_role:
        name: tarantool.cartridge
      vars:
        cartridge_custom_steps_dir: "./custom_steps"
```

### Editing topology without connecting to membership

Now there is a big problem on deploying huge clusters - [`connect_to_membership` step](#connect_to_membership) is too
long. Using scenario, we can solve this problem until it isn't solved in `cartridge`.

In fact `connect_to_membership` is used in [`set_control_instance` step](#set_control_instance) to find some instance
that is already in cluster. This instance should be used for joining other instances (otherwise two different clusters
are created). This instance is called `control_instance` and is used for editing topology and configuring cluster (auth,
config and so on). Generally, `connect_to_membership` step can be skipped if you definitely know some instance that is
already joined to cluster. The solution is to set `control_instance` fact manually and remove `connect_to_membership`
step from scenario:

```yaml
# edit_topology_playbook.yml

- name: Edit topology of my cluster
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Edit topology by core 1
      import_role:
        name: tarantool.cartridge
      vars:
        cartridge_scenario:
          - edit_topology
        control_instance:
          name: core_1
          console_sock: '/var/run/tarantool/core_1.control'
```

## Role Facts Descriptions
